This is your first post. You can edit it in any text editor — it's just Markdown.

To add a new article:

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`
2. Add the front matter at the top (layout, title, date)
3. Write your content below the second `---`

**Example:** `_posts/2025-03-01-swiftui-tips.md`

Replace this with your own posts when you're ready.
